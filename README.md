# File Injector

## 1. Description

File Injector is a script that allows you to **store any file** (`.zip`, `.png`, `.txt`, `.gba`...) and its **filename** in an **image/audio** as **noise**, using [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography).

You can also choose to **encrypt** the input file before storing it.

Then, to **extract** the file from the modified image/audio, you **DON'T need the original image/audio**, just the **encryption key** if the file has been encrypted.
